Signal

Getting great signal is just a Notion away. To learn about how to get great signal, checkout [this getting started guide here](https://support.neurosity.co/hc/en-us/sections/360007270652-Getting-started).

NotionJS can be a powerful tool for making sure the user's of your app are getting good signal out of their Notion. Understanding when you have good enough signal quality can be the difference between an amazing application and a dissapointing experience. 

In the early day's of Notion, signal quality should be checked before your experience starts.
