Ethics are at the core of every Notion. We believe that our collective future has all of us wearing brain computers for terrific, empowering, experiences. 

We must be careful to never share someone's raw data. We beleive raw brain wave data could maliciously be used for many different horrible outcomes. It's our hope that you use NotionJS to empower your mind and the mind of millions. Alone we may go fast, but together we'll go far.
